## To-Do List

### Basics
[] read xyz file
[] read topology file
[] determine initial velocities (Maxwell Boltzmann)
[] calculate forces
[] Velocity-Verlet Algorithm
[] Thermostat
[] Barostat

### How to calulcate the forces
[] Ubond: $k_{bond}$, $r$
[] Uangle: $k_{anlge}$, $\theta$
[] Udihedrals: $k_{dihedral}$, dihedral, $n$, phase?
[] Unonbonded(coulombic): partial charges 
[] Unonbonded(dispersion): LJ potential

### ideas
[] cutoff distance
[] be crazy (harmonic? not harmonic?) reactive FF?
[] code sth that creates a topology file (until then, we will use readily created topology files^)

### plan
[] start with a single molecule (water), then 
[] energy minimization
